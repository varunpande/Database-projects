This project simply demonstrates the ability to create a basic front end for interacting with a book database that I designed in my database class. I have also created a few stored procedures and triggers like book returns, membership expiration and borrowing activities on book.    

The project is currently hosted on http://vbp2538.uta.cloud/db.
